### Prediction of successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage using Machine Learning techniques
- Collected SpaceX launch data from SpaceX REST API.
- perform data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset
- build a dashboard to analyse launch records interactively
- use different machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression to determine the model with best accuracy
